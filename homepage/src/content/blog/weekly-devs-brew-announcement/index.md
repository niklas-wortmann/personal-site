The JavaScript ecosystem evolves rapidly, with new framework best practices, libraries, and tools emerging daily. As developers, we need a thoughtful way to process these changes.

## A Fresh Take on the Developer Newsletter

The idea for the Weekly Dev's Brew sparked during a conversation with [Daniel Roe](https://bsky.app/profile/danielroe.dev) about [Whisky Web and Whatnot](https://whiskey.fm/)'s format for tech discussions. While they chose whisky, I opted for coffee - because the best code reviews happen over a morning brew.
So join me to slow down, savor that morning brew, and thoughtfully digest the latest JavaScript ecosystem updates together.
