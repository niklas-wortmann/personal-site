  Do you struggle with TypeScript typings or feel like you hit a learning plateau? Are you constantly fighting your compiler and red squiggly lines in your editor? I am 99.99% sure the problem you are having is not with TypeScript but the way you are using it. Let me show you patterns you can use to minimize the time you feel like you are fighting TypeScript and allow you to still enjoy all its benefits. I'll use these patterns to help you learn to love TypeScript and feel confident using things like Type Guards, Generics and Type Inference, and help you keep your code base "as any" and "@ts-ignore" free.
