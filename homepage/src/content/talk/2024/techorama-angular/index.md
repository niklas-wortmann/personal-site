  Observables have been the Angular Community's reactive primitive since Angular 2 was released with a strict dependency on RxJS. However with the release of Angular version 16, a new reactive primitive has been introduced - Signals - leaving many developers wondering how this should impact their reactive workflows. Do Angular developers need multiple reactive primitives? Do developers still need RxJS? When should developers use Signals and when should they use Observables? And most critically, does the introduction of Signals necessitate refactoring an entire code base like with previous AngularJS applications?
  Letâ€™s find it out together, in this talk we will investigate what Angular developers NEED to know about switching to Signals, the differences between Observables and Signals, and provide best practices and patterns for making Angular applications more reactive today and for days to come!
