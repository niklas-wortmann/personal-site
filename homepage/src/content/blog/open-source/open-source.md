We'll drop $3000 on a laptop without blinking, but do a table flip over a $50 software license. It's time to rethink our priorities.
In the world of software development, we pride ourselves on creating value. We build the digital infrastructure that powers the modern world. Yet, there's a paradox at the heart of our industry: while we expect to be compensated fairly for our work, we often resist paying for the tools that make our work possible, more productive or just plain enjoyable.

## The Toolbox Disparity

Consider this:

- A handyman company doesn't think twice about buying quality hammers and drills.
- Accountants have their Excel licenses and financial software suites.
- Graphic designers invest in Adobe Creative Cloud or Figma without hesitation.
- Other professionals invest in their tools. Why do developers expect theirs for free?

But in the world of software development, there's an unspoken expectation that our tools should be free. We get cutting-edge laptops without question, we get access to video courses for several hundred dollars learning about technologies that are outdated in 2 years, but when it comes to the software we use daily, ideally 8 hours a day, we often default to free and open-source options.
But are these 'free' options really free? The time and support to build them has to come from somewhere

## The Hidden Costs of 'Free'

While I appreciate the availability of free tools, effectively lowering the entry barrier for getting into the industry, we do have to draw a clear line here.
This reliance on free tools isn't without consequences:

1. **Sustainability Issues**: Many open-source projects struggle to maintain their software long-term without financial support.
2. **Feature Limitations**: Free versions might lack advanced features that could boost productivity.
3. **Security Risks**: Underfunded projects may not have the resources to address vulnerabilities promptly.
4. **Support Gaps**: Free tools often come with limited or community-driven support, which can be a bottleneck for critical issues.

The 'free' in free software often comes at the cost of sustainability, security, and support. Is it really free then?

## The Exploitation of Goodwill

By relying solely on free and open-source tools, we're often exploiting the goodwill and passion of developers who create these projects. We're benefiting from their work without contributing to their ability to sustain it ([Tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons)).

Consider the [recent case of Nx](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/28150), a popular open-source monorepo tool.
The maintainers [announced](https://nx.dev/blog/introducing-nx-powerpack) that some features that were available (via internal APIs and deep imports) are going to be deprecated in favor of a new paid product.
This decision, while controversial, highlights the challenges faced by open-source projects trying to balance community needs with financial viability and sustainability.
Open source isn't a charity, that can be exploited to build multi-million dollar businesses.
It's a collaborative effort that requires sustainable funding to thrive, enabling the innovation we have witnessed over the last years.

## Rethinking Our Approach

It's time for a shift in perspective:

1. **Value Over Cost**: Instead of asking "Is it free?", we should ask "What value does it provide?"
2. **Investment in Productivity**: Paid tools often offer features that can significantly boost productivity, easily justifying their cost.
3. **Supporting Innovation**: By paying for software, we're investing in continued innovation and improvement of our tools.
4. **Professional Respect**: Valuing our tools shows respect for our craft and the effort that goes into creating developer tools.

Investing in quality tools is investing in your own productivity and the future of our craft!

## A Call to Action

As developers and as an industry, we need to:

1. Advocate for budgets for quality tools within our organizations.
2. Be willing to pay for individual licenses for tools that significantly improve our workflow.
3. Contribute financially or non-financially to open-source projects we rely on, whether through donations, paid tiers or active contributions.
4. Recognize the true value of the software we use daily.

## Conclusion

The laptop on your desk proves that your company values your work enough to invest in hardware. It's time we extended that logic to software. By being willing to pay for quality tools, we're not just improving our own workflows – we're contributing to a more sustainable, innovative, and considerate software ecosystem.

Let's change the conversation from "Why should we pay?" to "How can we ensure the tools we rely on thrive?" It's not just about the cost – it's about valuing our craft, our time, and the incredible ecosystem of tools that make our work possible.
Developers, it's time to put our money where our code is. Quality tools deserve quality support.
