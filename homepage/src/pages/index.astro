        >As a Developer Advocate for JetBrains, Jan-Niklas Wortmann isn't just
          another coderâ€”he's a code evangelist. With TypeScript as his weapon of
          choice, he's on a mission to make your dev life easier, one line at a
          time. Angular geek? He's got you covered. Obsessed with reactive
          programming? So is he. Outside of fine-tuning the developer experience
          at JetBrains, Jan is a Google Developer Expert for Angular and a part
          of the RxJS Core Team.
