February might seem like a weird time for the classic "year in review" post, but hear me out, considering that around 80% of New Year's Resolution are considered failed by the beginning of February. I'm just getting back from paternity leave (actually less sleep-deeprived than I anticipated). There's something about returning to work that makes you want to take stock of where you've been and where you're heading.

## The DevRel Life: Finding My Groove üéµ

Last year was a game-changer for my role as Developer Advocate at JetBrains. You know that moment when things just click? That was 2023 for me. So I went all excited into 2024. The developer community isn't just a target audience - it's become this amazing ecosystem where every conversation thrive and everything adds another piece to the puzzle.

I've been out there giving talks (probably saw some of you in the audience!), and let me tell you - there's nothing quite like the energy of live presentations. Sure, there were those classic ["demo gods, why have you forsaken me?" moments](https://youtu.be/p2JGWnUmdNw?si=AXTWXXrmkyNZe9wj&t=258), but each talk was a step towards better community engagement.

## The Personal Changelog üí™

```markdown
# 2024 Release Notes

+ Added: Muscle mass improvements

~ Pending: Reading goals (status: in progress)
```
Other than physical and emotional support my involvement in the delivery of baby Diana was rather secondary, but words can hardly describe the joy I feel! Everyone involved is healthy and doing well!

Let's be real - getting fitter while keeping up with tech life and having kids and family at home isn't exactly a walk in the park (though actual walks in the park helped!). But sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, and that might involve getting up at 5am to get in a workout. So setting a fixed schedule of particular workout days and time for each week helped me a lot to stick to my goals!

The reading situation?! Well, that was like that side project you keep meaning to get to. But 2025? Already knocked out 3 books in January. Sometimes you just need the right runtime environment (apparently paternity leave works for reading productivity - who knew?).

## What's Next? The Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

Public speaking is getting a major version update this year. For 2025 I want to be more intentional with my language and words of choice and generally improve my stage presence. Because let's face it - technical knowledge is only as good as the delivery.

And speaking of communication... There's something brewing in the content creation space. Can't spill all the beans yet, but I am working on something I am super excited to share with y'all in a few weeks. Watch this space for a major announcement!

## The Bottom Line

Coming back from paternity leave feels like deploying to production after a long development cycle. You've got fresh perspectives, few things pilled up while you were heads-down, and probably a couple fires to take care of.

Here's to 2025... well the rest of it!

*P.S. To those who've been part of this journey - whether through conference talks, community discussions, or just reading these words right now - thanks for being the best kind of dependencies one could ask for! üôè*
