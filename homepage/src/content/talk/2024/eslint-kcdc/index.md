  Join us as we dive into how ESLint can change your code quality and development speed. We'll cover the details and internals of static code analysis and show you exactly how ESLint can spot and fix issues, keeping your code clean and efficient. We're not just talking theory â€“ we'll get our hands dirty by creating custom ESLint rules that fit just right for your projects. This talk is all about giving you the real-world tools and know-how to make ESLint work harder for you, so you can write better code faster, without the headaches.
