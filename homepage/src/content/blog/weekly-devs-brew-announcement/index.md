The JavaScript ecosystem grows more complex by the day, with framework best-practices, libraries, and tools emerging daily
As developers, we need a thoughtful way to process these changes - much like we process our morning coffee, one sip at a time.

## A Fresh Take on the Developer Newsletter

This newsletter's origin is refreshingly simple: During a conversation with [Daniel Roe](https://bsky.app/profile/danielroe.dev)
he pointed out how [Whisky Web and Whatnot](https://whiskey.fm/) created an engaging format for tech discussions over drinks.
"Why not do something similar with coffee?" he suggested.
And while I definitely enjoy a good glass of scotch the idea resonated - because let's face it, the best code reviews happen over coffee, not whisky.
Once I formulated [my goals for this year](./2024-review) the original plan slightly changed though from a coffee inspired tech podcast over to a newsletter.

## Your Morning Technical Companion

My position in Developer Relations (separate from this newsletter) gives me a unique vantage point across the JavaScript ecosystem and its rapid evolution.
I regularly observe the evolution of frameworks, the emergence of new tools, and the real-world impact of architectural decisions.

## Weekly Technical Analysis You Can Trust

The Dev's Brew aims to be your morning technical companion - that quiet moment with your first cup where you can thoughtfully process
the JavaScript ecosystem's latest developments. This isn't another hype-driven tech newsletter.
Each week, as you enjoy your coffee (whether it's artisanal pour-over or pragmatic drip), you'll receive:

- In-depth JavaScript ecosystem insights
- Framework-agnostic technical analysis
- Frontend development news that impacts your workflow
- TypeScript insights for modern development
- Web development trends worth your attention
