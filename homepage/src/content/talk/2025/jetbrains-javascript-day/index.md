  Transparent communication is hard and frankly, we're not always great at it. We know you have questions about WebStorm's performance, pricing decisions, feature priorities, and the bugs that drive you crazy, but we rarely address them with the honesty they deserve. This talk changes that by giving you direct, unfiltered answers and a behind-the-scenes look at how we actually make product decisions, while also addressing the misconceptions and biases that might be keeping you from giving WebStorm a fair shot.
